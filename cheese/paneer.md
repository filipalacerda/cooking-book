# Paneer

## Ingredients
1. 2 liters of milk
2. Iogurt or Lemon juice or vinegar
3. Cold water

## Instructions
1. Pour 2 liters of milk into a heavy bottom pot and bring it to a gentle boil on a medium flame
2. Keep you acidic ingredients ready such as - yogurt, lemon juice or vinegar. Please use only one. When the milk comes to a boil, turn off the stove. Add 2 tablespoons of vinegar or 1/2 cup of yougurt. Give it a good stir for 1 minute
3. Milk begins to curdle immediately and solids separate from the whey. Id it does not, stir 1 tablespoon more vinegar and turn on the stove. Boil til you see the solids separate completelu. Note that non-homogenized or raw milk cirdles daster. Homogenized milk takes longer to curdle as it is processed for a good shelf life.
4. Turn off the stove as soon as you see the milk has curdled completely. When the paneer is done correctly you will see the whey being clear and not milky. The color of the whey will be yellowish or green but nor milk white. Is is important you turn off when it is done.
5. Place a colander over a large bowl (to collect the whey). Layer it with a clean cheese cloth. A thin new handkerchief works well too. Transfer all of the curdled milk to the colander, in batches. Immediately pour cold water to get rid of the vinegar smell.
6. Later, rinse the paneer well a few times under running water until it is clear of the vinegar
7. Squeeze off the excess water. Make a knot and hang this for 30 mins. This helps drain the excess whey and this step is ery essential else the  paneer can break in your sauce. It should still be moist after draining.
8. Keep the entire  pack on a flat colander or a plare or a wooden board. Form a nice round shape by bundling the paneer.
9. Place a heavy object weighing at least 2.5 to 3kgs. Allow it to set for about 3 to 4 hours. If you want you may move the entire set up to the refrigerator if it is too hot.
10. Remove the cloth and you will find a round block of paneer. You will also notice a dent on the block. It is just normal.
11. Cube the paneer
12. Use or refrigerate for further use.You can also cut them and freeze for 3 months or refrigerate for 2 to 3 weeks.

## Tips
1. Full fat milk that is minimally processed works the best.
2. Bring milk to a boil on a low to medium heat else the fats can settle at the bottom anf get scorched in brown bits. Alternately, stir the milk occasionally while boiling.
3. Always add the acidic ingredient only after the milk comes to a boil
4. Once the acid ingredient is added to the milk, stir and check if the milk has curdled completely.
