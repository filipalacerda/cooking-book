# Halloumi Cheese

## Equipment
1. 1 soup pan
2. Cheese cloth
3. colander
4. cheese mold
5. food thermometer

## Ingredients
1. 2 litres pasturised full cream milk
2. 1/2 tsp rennet Renco mixed with 1/2 tsp water

## Instructions
1. In a large stainless steel saucepan heat the milk to 32ºC, using a food thermometer
2. Add the rennet when milk has reached 32ºC and stir a few seconds until you know that it is properly distributed
3. Let the milk sit with a lid on the pan in an unheated oven for about 40 minutes or until a firm curd has formed and the whey is clearly separated from the curd
4. Cut the curds into squares trying to keep them in the same size as much as possible. This is easy with a sharp knife
5. Rest for 5 minutes, then using a waterbath keep the pan to 35º to 38ºC and stir gently with yout hand or a spoon. You can do this on the stove but I found it easier to control the temperature through a waterbath
6. The squares should look smoooth and lightly elastic
7. Carefully drain the contents of the pan into a colander lined with cheesecloth and let it drain until the majority of the whey is gone. About 30 minutes. Make sure to catch the whey in a pot below the colander. You need it later
8. Put the curds into a cheese mold. I used one of 750gr content. Line the mould with cheesecloth put the curds in and cover with the cheesecloth. Put a chopping board on top and weigh it down with a pan filled with water
9. Let it sit for at least an hour (probably two) and maybe even longer, until the cheese that comes out is quite firm
10. Now cut the Halloumi cheese into thick sliced of about 1-2 centimeter each
11. Reheat the whey to 85ºC-90ºC, then turn the heat off and add the halloumi pieces to the whey.
12. Cook for about 20 minutes, stirring from time to time. The cheese will rise to the surface.
13. Take the cheese slices out, add a pinch of salt on each side and let them fry for a bit on a cooling rack.
14. Make a brine with 50% leftover whey, 50% boiling water and 10% salt and put the halloumi pieces in.
15. The halloumi will keep up to two weeks in the brine, in the fridge.
